We haven't made this project public yet,so the API will still be local<br/>
If you want to run it on your machine, follow these commands:
1. Open CMD on your PC
2. Run ipconfig
3. Find your Ipv4 <br/> `IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.15`
4. GO to \Flutter Front-End\UPOX-FE\lib\Components\api_internet_component and overwrite your IPv4 into Domain name<br/>
`  static String domainName = "http://192.168.1.15:8080"; `
> [!NOTE]
> We will try to deploy the product as soon as possible so everything can only run locally for now.
